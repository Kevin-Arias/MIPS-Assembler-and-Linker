# MIPS-Assembler-and-Linker

I implemented an assembler that assembles MIPS files into .out files. I also implemented a linker so that it will read all of the inputted .out files and write their instructions to a single output file. It will calculate the absolute addresses for the labels/instructions that need relocation, and fill in these absolute addresses into the necessary instructions all in MIPS
